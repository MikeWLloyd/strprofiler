  abstract = {Continuous cell lines consist of cultured cells derived from a specific donor and tissue of origin that have acquired the ability to proliferate indefinitely. These cell lines are well-recognized models for the study of health and disease, particularly for cancer. However, there are cautions to be aware of when using continuous cell lines, including the possibility of contamination, in which a foreign cell line or microorganism is introduced without the handler's knowledge. Cross-contamination, in which the contaminant is another cell line, was first recognized in the 1950s but, disturbingly, remains a serious issue today. Many cell lines become cross-contaminated early, so that subsequent experimental work has been performed only on the contaminant, masquerading under a different name. What can be done in response\textemdash how can a researcher know if their own cell lines are cross-contaminated? Two practical responses are suggested here. First, it is important to check the literature, looking for previous work on cross-contamination. Some reports may be difficult to find and to make these more accessible, we have compiled a list of known cross-contaminated cell lines. The list currently contains 360 cell lines, drawn from 68 references. Most contaminants arise within the same species, with HeLa still the most frequently encountered (29\%, 106/360) among human cell lines, but interspecies contaminants account for a small but substantial minority of cases (9\%, 33/360). Second, even if there are no previous publications on cross-contamination for that cell line, it is essential to check the sample itself by performing authentication testing.},

  abstract = {Continuous human cell lines have been used extensively as models for biomedical research. In working with these cell lines, researchers are often unaware of the risk of cross-contamination and other causes of misidentification. To reduce this risk, there is a pressing need to authenticate cell lines, comparing the sample handled in the laboratory to a previously tested sample. The American Type Culture Collection Standards Development Organization Workgroup ASN-0002 has developed a Standard for human cell line authentication, recommending short tandem repeat (STR) profiling for authentication of human cell lines. However, there are known limitations to the technique when applied to cultured samples, including possible genetic drift with passage. In our study, a dataset of 2,279 STR profiles from four cell banks was used to assess the effectiveness of the match criteria recommended within the Standard. Of these 2,279 STR profiles, 1,157 were grouped into sets of related cell lines\textemdash duplicate holdings, legitimately related samples or misidentified cell lines. Eight core STR loci plus amelogenin were used to unequivocally authenticate 98\% of these related sets. Two simple match algorithms each clearly discriminated between related and unrelated samples, with separation between related samples at {$\geq$}80\% match and unrelated samples at {$<$}50\% match. A small degree of overlap was noted at 50\textendash 79\% match, mostly from cell lines known to display variable STR profiles. These match criteria are recommended as a simple and effective way to interpret results from STR profiling of human cell lines.},

It is shown that the similarity index--the average fraction of shared restriction fragments--provides upwardly biased estimates of population homozygosity but nearly unbiased estimates of the average identity-in-state for random pairs of individuals. A method is suggested for partitioning the DNA-fingerprint dissimilarity into within- and between-population components. Some simple expressions are given for the sampling variances of these estimators.},

  abstract = {Despite an increased awareness of the problematic of cell line cross-contamination and misidentification, it remains nowadays a major source of erroneous experimental results in biomedical research. To prevent it, researchers are expected to frequently test the authenticity of the cell lines they are working on. STR profiling was selected as the international reference method to perform cell line authentication. While the experimental protocols and manipulations for generating a STR profile are well described, the available tools and workflows to analyze such data are lacking. The Cellosaurus knowledge resource aimed to improve the situation by compiling all the publicly available STR profiles from the literature and other databases. As a result, it grew to become the largest database in terms of human STR profiles, with 6,474 distinct cell lines having an associated STR profile (release July 31, 2019). Here we present CLASTR, the Cellosaurus STR similarity search tool enabling users to compare one or more STR profiles with those available in the Cellosaurus cell line knowledge resource. It aims to help researchers in the process of cell line authentication by providing numerous functionalities. The tool is publicly accessible on the SIB ExPASy server (https://web.expasy.org/cellosaurus-str-search) and its source code is available on GitHub under the GPL-3.0 license.},

  abstract = {Short tandem repeat (STR) regions represent highly polymorphic microsatellite markers in the human gnome that have tandemly repetitive sequence elements of 2 to 7 by in length as a unit. The application of STR regions to population genetics and personal identification has been well studied. Recent technical advances have enabled us to analyze multilocus STR regions simultaneously by a method, called the STR Multiplex system, that uses a single PCR amplification in one tube. We established a new evaluation system for the identification of cell lines based on an STR Multiplex method that uses 9 different loci: D5S818, D13S317, D7S820, D16S539, vWA, TH01, Amelogenin, TPDX, and CSF1P0. The STR profiling data from 96 cell lines were examined and an efficiency of this approach for cell standardization was found. Using this method, we have analyzed the STR profiles of human cell lines, ECV304, EJ1, and 124, recently reported by the DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures to have been cross-contaminated. Our results clearly detect the cross-contamination between ECV304 and EJ-1/T24. The cross-contamination was estimated to be derived from the T24 cells. Collectively, the STR Multiplex system provides a rapid, precise, and powerful method in cell line identification for quality control at the JCRB Cell Bank.},
