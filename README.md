# strprofiler
 **strprofiler** is a simple python utility to compare short tandem repeat (STR) profiles. In particular, it is designed to aid research labs in comparing models (e.g. cell lines & xenografts) generated from primary tissue samples to ensure contamination has not occurred. It includes basic checks for sample mixing and contamination.

For each STR profile provided, **strprofiler** will generate a sample-specific report that includes the following similarity scores as compared to every other profile:
